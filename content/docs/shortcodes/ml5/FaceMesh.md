## Facemesh with Webcam Demo
Facemesh is a machine-learning model that allows for facial landmark detection in the browser. It can detect multiple faces at once and provides 486 3D facial landmarks that describe the geometry of each face. Facemesh works best when the faces in view take up a large percentage of the image or video frame and it may struggle with small/distant faces.
