It can detect multiple faces at once and provides 486 3D facial landmarks that describe the geometry of each face. Facemesh works best when the faces in view take up a large percentage of the image or video frame and it may struggle with small/distant faces.

It can detect a maximum of one hand at a time and provides 21 3D hand keypoints that describe important locations on the palm and fingers.

It should be noted that the pre-trained model provided by the example below was trained on a database of approximately 15 million images (ImageNet). The ml5 library accesses this model from the cloud. What the algorithm labels an image is entirely dependent on that training data &amp;ndash; what is included, excluded, and how those images are labeled (or mislabeled).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jhsrojasro.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/ml5/PoseNet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jhsrojasro.github.io/showcase/docs/shortcodes/ml5/PoseNet/</guid><description>PoseNet example using p5.js # PoseNet is a machine learning model that allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation.
PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.
